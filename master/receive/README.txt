EE-459/master/receive/README.txt

this directory contains code that is intended to integrate the RFM69 transceiver with the GPS. In this directory, the program will
continuously receive messages from the sender. If the transceiver has received a message from the sender, it will display the GPS
coordinates for the "friend". Otherwise, the program will display the location of the own device.
